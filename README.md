## Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This assignment has two parts:  
  I) First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.  
  II) Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.
    

### Your Shiny Application

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation.  
2. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.  
3. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server   
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on Github
